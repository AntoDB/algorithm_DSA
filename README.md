# DSA - Exercices (practical) from geeksforgeeks.org
This repo contain the codes for an HE2B - ISIB course for DSA and algortithm.
The course follow the website https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/learn-data-structures-and-algorithms-dsa-tutorial/.

Like I say in the licence file :
> I don't authorise people from HE2B - ISIB to copy my code to validate the exercice from geeksforgeeks.org without first testing with their own code.

Code and enjoy ðŸ˜‰
