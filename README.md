# DSA - Exercices (practical) from geeksforgeeks.org
This repo contain the codes for an HE2B - ISIB course for DSA. The course's title is algorithms and data structure.
The course follow the website https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/learn-data-structures-and-algorithms-dsa-tutorial/.

### What you can't do
Like I say in the licence file :
> I don't authorise people from HE2B - ISIB to copy my code to validate the exercice from geeksforgeeks.org without first testing with their own code.

### Infos about code files
The last version of each exercice is functionnal (except perhaps the last exercise).
The previous versions, some of them are functionnal but to slow and not optimise, other are not functionnal (error).

Code and enjoy ðŸ˜‰
